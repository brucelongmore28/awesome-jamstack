# Why Flycode?
FlyCode helps developers & product teams to ship faster by eliminating the back-and-forth around product edits. 
With FlyCode, developers can approve changes to the product instead of making them. We're saving teams around 30% of delivery time.

# What should i do now?

## FlyCode scans
the code to find product resources and configuration: for code repositories that you choose to install FlyCode for, we scan for text, images, and config sections of your product.
## Product Managers and Designers directly edit the product:
they can edit anything FlyCode identifies in the product visually and submit changes for the developers to review
## Developers approve changes through Git, matching their existing workflow:
For all the changes made with FlyCode, a Pull Request (or Merge Request) will be sent to the developers in the way they usually work.

And in short:
