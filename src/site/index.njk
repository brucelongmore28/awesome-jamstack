  <h2 class="heading">What would be considered JAMstack?</h2>
  <p>
    You may have already seen or worked on a JAMstack site! They do not have to include all attributes of JavaScript, APIs, and Markup.
  </p>
  <p>
    They might be built using Gatsby | Vue | Next | Nuxt | Jekyll | Hugo...
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      The thing that they all have in common is that they don’t depend on a web server.

  <h2 class="heading lg:px-8 lg:text-center">What are the benefits of JAMstack?</h2>
  <p class="heading lg:px-8 lg:mb-6 lg:text-center">
    There are many benefits to this approach to web development, such as:
  </p>

    <div class="lg:w-5/12 lg:text-center">
      <h3 class="heading"> Security</h3>
      <p>
        The JAMstack removes multiple moving parts and systems from the hosting infrastructure resulting in fewer servers and systems to harden against attack.
      </p>
      <p class="bg-gray-700 py-2 px-4 rounded">
        There is no server more secure than the one which does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Serving pages and assets as pre-generated files allows read-only hosting reducing attack vectors even further. Meanwhile dynamic tools and services can be provided by vendors with teams dedicated to securing their specific systems and providing high levels of service.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="lg:w-5/12 lg:text-center">
      <h3 class="heading"> Scale</h3>
      <p>
        Popular architectures deal with heavy traffic loads by adding logic to cache popular views and resources. The JAMstack provides this by default. When sites can be served entirely from a <a href="/glossary#cdn" title="Glossary: Content Delivery Network">CDN</a> there is no complex logic or workflow to determine what assets can be cached and when.
      </p>
      <p>
        With JAMstack sites everything can be cached in a content delivery network. With simpler deployments, built-in redundancy and incredible load capacity.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="lg:w-5/12 lg:text-center">
      <h3 class="heading"> Performance</h3>
      <p>
        Page loading speeds have an impact on user experience and conversion. JAMstack sites remove the need to generate page views on a server at request time by instead generating pages ahead of time during a build.
      </p>
      <p>With all the pages are already available on a CDN close to the user and ready to serve, very high performance is possible without introducing expensive or complex infrastructure.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="lg:w-5/12 lg:text-center">
      <h3 class="heading"> Maintainability</h3>
      <p>
        When hosting complexity is reduced, so are maintenance tasks. A pre-generated site, being served directly from a simple host or directly from a CDN doesn't need a team of experts to "keep the lights on".
      </p>
      <p>
        The work was done during the build, so now the generated site is stable and can be hosted without servers which might require patching, updating and maintain.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="lg:w-5/12 lg:text-center">
      <h3 class="heading"> Portability</h3>
      <p>
        JAMstack sites are pre-generated. That means that you can host them from a wide variety of hosting services and have greater ability to move them to your preferred host. Any simple static hosting solution should be able to serve a JAMstack site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bye-bye infrastructure lock-in.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="lg:w-5/12 lg:text-center">
      <h3 class="heading"> Developer Experience</h3>
      <p>
        JAMstack sites can be built with a wide variety of tools. They do not depend on the proprietary technologies or exotic and little known frameworks. Instead, they build on widely available tools and conventions. As a result, it's not hard to find enthusiastic and talented developers who have the right skills to build with the JAMstack. Efficiency and effectiveness can soar. Just take a look at what developers are saying about working with the JAMstack.
