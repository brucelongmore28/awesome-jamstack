  <h2>Why Jamstack</h2>
  <p>
    The Jamstack architecture has many benefits, whether you’re building a large e-commerce site, SaaS application or personal blog.
  </p>
  {{ section.benefit(
      "Better Performance",
      "icon-disc-security.svg",
      "<p>
        Why wait for pages to build on the fly when you can generate them at deploy time? When it comes to minimizing the time to first byte, nothing beats pre-built files served over a CDN.
      </p>")
  }}
  {{ section.benefit(
      "Higher Security",
      "icon-disc-security.svg",
      "<p>
        With server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced. You can also leverage the domain expertise of specialist third-party services.
      </p>")
  }}
  {{ section.benefit(
    "Cheaper, Easier Scaling",
    "icon-disc-security.svg",
    "<p>
      When your deployment amounts to a stack of files that can be served anywhere, scaling is a matter of serving those files in more places. CDNs are perfect for this, and often include scaling in all of their plans.
    </p>")
  }}
  {{ section.benefit(
    "Better Developer Experience",
    "icon-disc-security.svg",
    "<p>
      Loose coupling and separation of controls allow for more targeted development and debugging, and the expanding selection of CMS options for site generators remove the need to maintain a separate stack for content and marketing.
    </p>")

  <h2>The future is highly distributed</h2>
  <p>
    Jamstack is the new standard architecture for the web. Using Git workflows and modern build tools, pre-rendered   content is served to a CDN and made dynamic through APIs and serverless functions.Technologies in the stack include JavaScript frameworks, Static Site Generators, Headless CMSs, and CDNs.

  <h2>Jamstack-Powered Projects</h2>
  <p>
    You have likely visited —and may have even worked on— a Jamstack site, which is commonly built using a static site generator like Gatsby, Next, Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty or Nuxt.
